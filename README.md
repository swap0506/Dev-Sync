Dev-Sync is a dynamic social networking platform specifically designed for developers to connect, collaborate, and share their expertise. The application provides a seamless way for users to create and manage personalized profiles, showcasing their professional skills, work experience, and GitHub repositories. With secure authentication features, it ensures a safe environment for users to interact.

One of the core functionalities of Dev-Sync is its forum system, where developers can engage in meaningful discussions by creating posts, sharing ideas, and offering feedback. The integration of the GitHub API enhances the user experience by allowing developers to display their latest repositories directly on their profiles, making it easier to share their projects with others.

Built using modern web technologies, the project demonstrates best practices in full-stack development, with a robust Node.js backend and a focus on scalability and usability. Dev-Sync serves as both a networking tool for developers and a practical learning resource for building feature-rich, real-world web applications.
